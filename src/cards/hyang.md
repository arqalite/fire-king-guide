Full power Garunix ahead - better watch out!

As soon as this card hits the field, it will immediately clear the board.

Generally you will make this via [_Fire King Sanctuary_] during your opponent's turn,
ideally during a vulnerable moment where clearing their board shuts them down completely,
or at least leaves them with little options for recovery.

The Spell/Trap destruction effect, with the associated ATK boost is helpful but comes up rarely,
as you usually will prefer to preserve the materials so the third effect is more explosive.

By destroying Hyang with both of its materials, you can Special Summon 2 Fire Kings from the GY.
Alongside [_Circle of the Fire Kings_], this can enable an OTK.

Assuming the field is now empty except Hyang, you can direct attack for 3000,
then use Circle to pop Hyang and revive something else. Hyang triggers,
reviving itself and Sacred Garunix (he's most likely always one of the materials).
Attack with both for 3000 + 2700 = 5700 damage,
for a total of 8700 (plus the monster revived by Circle, usually 10k damage).
