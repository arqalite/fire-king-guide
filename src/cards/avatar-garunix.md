Teenage Ponix - and like any teenager, this card is *awkward*.

The second effect is too impractical for the modern game, requiring your opponent to destroy it,
and it limits the type of monsters you can summon due to requiring a "Fire King Avatar" specifically (so, no [_Sacred Fire King Garunix_] or [_Fire King High Avatar Kirin_]).

This means it doesn't really have a place in today's decks - **running 0 copies is for the best.**
