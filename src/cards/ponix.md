Definitely the cutest Fire King, and arguably the most important card in the deck too.

Ponix is your starter - you'll almost always want to summon him during your first turn to search [_Fire King Sanctuary_], which will get the Fire King engine started (see the **Combos** section).

If destroyed during your combo, it will return to your hand during the next Standby Phase - this ensures you constantly have a FIRE monster or Fire King in hand to destroy for effects like [_Fire King Avatar Arvata_]'s negate,
or [_Fire King High Avatar Kirin_]'s effect to Special Summon itself, both of which require you to destroy a FIRE monster in your hand or field.

Later on, you can make use of his effect to search [_Fire King Sky Burn_] or [_Circle of the Fire Kings_] to destroy your opponent's cards, extend your board, or push for an OTK.

**It's recommended to always run 3 copies.**
