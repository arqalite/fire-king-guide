Garunix in ceremonial clothing? Or just an older, more seasoned Garunix?
How about a crucial component of the deck?
If Ponix is the spark that starts the fire, Sacred Garunix is the fuel.

99% of the time you will be searching him
with [_Fire King Island_], ideally after destroying a FIRE monster.
This causes his first effect to trigger and Special Summon himself immediately from hand.
Note that he can Special Summon himself from the GY too,
provided he is already there when a FIRE monster gets destroyed.

Over the course of longer games, you'll constantly summon and destroy Fire Kings,
which means Sacred Garunix will always hit the field every turn,
bringing reinforcements via his second effect.

That effect is usually the main way to get other Fire Kings into rotation.
You'll often destroy [_Fire King Avatar Arvata_] or [_Fire King High Avatar Kirin_],
both of which allow you to Special Summon a Fire King from the GY.

You can also destroy his younger self - [_Fire King High Avatar Garunix_],
causing Sacred to have 4050 ATK - sufficient to run over most monsters.
(Watch out for High Avatar Garunix blowing up the field in the next Standby Phase, though!)

A third option is destroying ~~his waifu~~ [_Fire King Courtier Ulcanix_],
which gets High Avatar Garunix even faster on the field (albeit without clearing the board),
letting you Xyz Summon any Rank 8 of your choosing.
Or you can wait for an optimal moment to Xyz Summon [_Garunix Eternity, Hyang of the Fire Kings_]
via [_Fire King Sanctuary_], disrupting your opponent in the process.

Keep in mind that Sacred Garunix can be a brick by himself - thus you will either want to keep him in the deck,
or ensure you draw Ponix or Island alongside him. **Running 2 copies seems optimal**,
however 3 copies are also perfectly fine.
