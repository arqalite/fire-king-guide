# 1-card - Ponix

## Requirements
- Cards in hand:
  - [_Legendary Fire King Ponix_]
- Cards in main deck:
  - [_Sacred Fire King Garunix_]
  - [_Fire King High Avatar Kirin_]
  - [_Fire King Avatar Barong_]
  - [_Fire King Sanctuary_]
  - [_Fire King Island_]
- Cards in extra deck:
  - [_Garunix Eternity, Hyang of the Fire Kings_]

## When to perform this combo
Generally you'll only want to go this route if Ponix is the only FIRE monster in your hand, otherwise the Ponix + any FIRE monster combo is preferred.

You could also go this route if you suspect your opponent has [_Nibiru, the Primal Being_] as we perform only 2 Special Summons.
However you will need to draw sufficient interruptions to assist Hyang's board clear against most meta decks.

## Steps
### Your turn
- Normal Summon [_Legendary Fire King Ponix_].
- Activate Ponix's effect to search [_Fire King Sanctuary_].
- Activate Sanctuary from hand, place [_Fire King Island_] in Field Zone.
- Activate Island's effect to destroy Ponix and search [_Sacred Fire King Garunix_].
- Activate Sacred Garunix's first effect to Special Summon itself from hand.
- Activate Sacred Garunix's second effect to destroy [_Fire King Avatar Barong_] from deck.

### Opponent's turn
- In **Standby Phase**:
  - Activate Ponix's effect to add itself back to hand.
  - Activate Barong's effect to add [_Fire King High Avatar Kirin_] from deck to hand.
- During **Main Phase 1**:
  - Activate High Kirin's effect to destroy Ponix from hand and Special Summon itself.
- Whenever your opponent **Special Summons** and you're ready to clear the board:
  - Activate Sanctuary's effect to Xyz Summon [_Garunix Eternity, Hyang of the Fire Kings_] by overlaying Sacred Garunix and High Kirin.
  - Activate Hyang's effect to destroy all monsters on the field.

## Notes
- This is the most basic combo of the deck, and most other combos build on top of it, or vary upon it.
- This combo plays under [_Nibiru, the Primal Being_]'s 5 summon threshold,
making it an option if you drew into multiple interruptions (handtraps or trap cards)
and you suspect your opponent might have Nibiru in their hand.

## Chokepoints
- This combo ends immediately if either Ponix or Island get negated.
  - If you have High Kirin in hand, you can dodge targeting negation on Ponix
  (think [_Effect Veiler_] or [_Infinite Impermanence_]) by chaining High Kirin's effect
  to destroy Ponix before the negation resolves.
- If Sacred Garunix's 2nd effect gets negated, you will be unable to search High Kirin, and thus summon Hyang.
  You will need other methods to reach High Kirin, or rely on the interruptions you have in your hand to survive until the next turn.
