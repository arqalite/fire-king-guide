# 2-card - Ponix + Arvata/High Kirin (without Princess)

## Requirements
- Cards in hand:
  - [_Legendary Fire King Ponix_]
  - [_Fire King Avatar Arvata_] or [_Fire King High Avatar Kirin_]


## When to perform this combo
Generally you should only go for this combo if you do not own Promethean Princess, and you did not draw [_Fire King Courtier Ulcanix_].
If you do own Princess, perform the [1.5-card - Ponix + any FIRE monster] combo instead.

## Steps
### Your turn
1. Normal Summon [_Legendary Fire King Ponix_].
2. Activate Ponix's effect to search [_Fire King Sanctuary_].
3. Activate Sanctuary from hand, place [_Fire King Island_] in Field Zone.
4. If the FIRE monster on your hand is **NOT A Fire King**, Link Summon [_Salamangreat Almiraj_] using Ponix as material.
    - You can still Link Summon Almiraj if you have a Arvata or High Kirin,
    and this will let you Special Summon Ponix from GY using their effects.
5. Activate Island's effect to destroy the FIRE monster in your hand, and search [_Sacred Fire King Garunix_].
    - If the destroyed monster was a Fire King, like Arvata and Kirin, you may be able to use their effects.
6. Activate Sacred Garunix's first effect to Special Summon itself from hand.
7. Activate Sacred Garunix's second effect to destroy [_Fire King Avatar Arvata_] from deck.
    - NOTE: If the FIRE monster in your hand was Arvata already, destroy [_Fire King High Avatar Kirin_] instead, as Arvata cannot Special Summon itself.
8. Activate Arvata/Kirin's effect to special summon a Fire King from GY (either Ponix or the card you destroyed from hand)
9. Link Summon [_Salamangreat Sunlight Wolf_] using either Sacred Garunix + Almiraj, or Sacred Garunix + the Fire King destroyed from hand.
10. Link Summon [_Relinquished Anima_] using Ponix, in the zone *directly under* Sunlight Wolf.
11. Activate Sunlight Wolf's effect to add a FIRE from your GY to your hand (except Arvata!).
12. Link Summon [_Promethean Princess, Bestower of Flames_] using Sunlight Wolf and Anima.
13. Activate Princess's effect to Special Summon Arvata/any FIRE from GY.
14. **Optionally**, Link Summon [_Amphibious Swarmship Amblowhale_] using Princess and the FIRE you revived.

## Notes
- If you opt to stay on Princess + Arvata, you can expect to have the following interruptions:
  - A monster negate off Arvata, destroying Princess,
  - Sacred Garunix Special Summoning itself from GY, destroying a Fire King from deck.
    - You could go for High Kirin to revive another Fire King and destroy a card on the field.
    - Or you could go for Ulcanix to Special Summon a [_Fire King High Avatar Garunix_], to set up the Xyz Summon of Hyang via Sanctuary later on.
  - Princess' effect to Special Summon herself by destroying 1 card on each side of the field.
    - You can pop your Arvata here after it used its negate, to revive another Fire King.
  - If you have Kirin in hand, you can use its effect to Summon itself by destroying a FIRE monster.
  - If you have two Level 8s on your side of the field, you can activate Sanctuary and Xyz Summon Hyang using them as material,
  then using its effect to destroy all monsters on the field.

- If you end on Amblowhale, you have the following:
  - Princess effect to pop Amblowhale and an opponent's card to Special Summon herself,
  - Amblowhale effect to Special Summon a Link-3 or lower, probably Sunlight Wolf or Almiraj.
  - Sacred Garunix Special Summoning itself from GY, destroying a Fire King from deck.
    - If you pop High Kirin here, you can revive Arvata for a monster negate.
    - Or go for Ulcanix to set up 2 Level 8s via [_Fire King High Avatar Garunix_].
  - If a Link-3 or lower is destroyed, Amblowhale can banish itself from GY to destroy a card on the field.
  - If you have Kirin in hand, you can use its effect to Summon itself by destroying a FIRE monster.
  - If you have 2 Level 8s, you can make Hyang to clear the board.

## Chokepoints
- This combo goes past [_Nibiru, the Primal Being_]'s 5 summon threshold, making this combo potentially risky.
  - If the FIRE monster you destroyed from hand is Arvata, Special Summon it when using High Kirin's effect (step 8.).
  This provides you with a monster negate exactly on the 5th summon (assuming you also used Arvata to summon back a card), but at the cost of another Fire King from hand or field.
- As with the [1-card Ponix combo], a negate resolving on Ponix or Island can stop you entirely.
- If Sacred Garunix's 2nd effect gets negated, you will have only 2 bodies on the field.
  If [_Ash Blossom & Joyous Spring_] was used against you, you could Link Summon [_Hiita the Fire Charmer, Ablaze_]
  and steal their Ash Blossom so you can still make Princess, then Amblowhale.
