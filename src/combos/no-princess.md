# Lines without Promethean Princess

[_Promethean Princess, Bestower of Flames_] plays an important role in most Fire King combos,
but at about 15$ (as of September 2024), she can be out of some people's budgets
or just out of their comfort zone regarding cardboard pricing.

Don't worry, we can still make plays without her, but the lines are slightly different and aren't as strong anymore.

For example, you can no longer make [_Amphibious Swarmship Amblowhale_] with [_Legendary Fire King Ponix_] + any FIRE monster.
That line now requires Ponix and either [_Fire King Avatar Arvata_] or [_Fire King High Avatar Kirin_],
as you need their last effect in order to generate enough material for Amblowhale.
You also don't have a way to avoid Nibiru anymore - you'll have to rely on cards like [_Crossout Designator_] (if available).

The Ponix + any FIRE monster line is [forced to end on a much weaker board]. It now ends on [_Salamangreat Almiraj_] and [_Duelittle Chimera_],
betting on the opponent not having any non-destructive removal handy and generating card advantage upon Duelittle being destroyed by battle.
